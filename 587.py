"""
Generally, we must have ratio of orange equal to ratio of
area above line in rightmost circle. This is the case since the
circles are bisected by a line. We can see this easiest by observing
the center circle for odd n, which must bisected by symmetry.

More specifically, if we have n circles, the angle of orange is
45/n degrees
